# Reinforcement-Trader
# How to Use
To use the code and replicate the results in the notebook:

Ensure you have installed the required dependencies as mentioned in the installation section.

Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script provided in this repository.

Follow the instructions in the notebook/script to train the reinforcement learning agent and analyze the stock trading strategy.

# Methodology
# Bollinger Bands Strategy
The project employs a trading strategy based on Bollinger Bands. Bollinger Bands consist of three components: the middle band, the upper band, and the lower band. The middle band represents the moving average of the stock's price over a specified period. The upper and lower bands are calculated by adding and subtracting a certain number of standard deviations from the middle band, respectively.

The trading strategy involves making buy and sell decisions based on the price's position relative to the Bollinger Bands. For example, when the price crosses below the lower band, it might trigger a buy signal, and when it crosses above the upper band, it might trigger a sell signal.

# Results
The notebook provides an analysis of the reinforcement learning agent's performance and the effectiveness of the Bollinger Bands trading strategy. The results include metrics such as end-dollar profits, Sharpe ratio, and potentially other risk-adjusted measures.

Please refer to the notebook for more detailed results and visualizations.
